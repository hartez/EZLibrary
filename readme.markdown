E.Z.'s Mildly Useful Library
============================

This is a library of useful bits of code I use in multiple projects. Some of it is stuff I've written, other bits are cobbled together from helpful blog posts (with an effort made toward attribution where appropriate). 

Stuff that's in here (so far):
=====================
* Interactivity triggers and gestures for Windows Phone 7
* Some string extension methods for dealing with delimited lists
* ObservableStack - A Stack that implements INotifyCollectionChanged
* LittleWatson - An implementation of the error reporting code described at [Andy Pennell's Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/andypennell/archive/2010/11/01/error-reporting-on-windows-phone-7.aspx)

You can also get the WP7 versions (both 7.0 and 7.1) as a [NuGet package](http://nuget.org/packages/EZLibrary.WindowsPhone)

Disclaimer
----------

I use this stuff in my own code, so it's probably more-or-less okay. But all use is at your own risk.
